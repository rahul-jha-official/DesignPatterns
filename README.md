# DesignPatterns

- Design patterns are the common architectural approaches
- Popularized by the Gang of Four book(1994)
  - Smalltalk and C++
- Translated to many OOP languages i.e., Java, C#
- Universally relevant
  - Internalized in some programming languages
  - Libraries
  - Your own code

# Gamma Categorization
- Design Patterns are typically split into three categories.
- This is called Gamma Categorization after Erich Gamma, one of GoF authors
 
Design patterns provide general solutions or a flexible way to solve common design problems.

- **Creational Patterns**
  - Deals with the creation (construction) of objects
  - Eplicit (constructor) vs implicit (DI, reflection, etc)
  - Wholesale (single statement) vs piecewise (step-by-step)
- **Structural Patterns**
  - Concerned with the structure (eg, class member)
  - Many patterns are wrappers that mimic the underlying class interface.
  - Stress the importance of good API design
- **Behavioral Patterns**
  - They are all different; no central theme
