  # Single Responsibility Principle
Single Responsibility Principle says, "Every software module should have only one reason to change.".</br>
This means that every class or similar structure in your code should have only one job. Everything in that class should be related to a single purpose. It does not mean that your classes should only contain one method or property. There may be many members as long as they relate to a single responsibility.
